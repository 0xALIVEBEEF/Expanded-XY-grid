# Expanded-XY-grid
Custom script for AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui that adds more features to the standard xy grid

Features added:
Multitool (still working on getting the step count to be correct)
Customizable prompt matrix
S/R Placeholder
Group files in a directory (still working on)
Add PNGinfo to grid image

The code may be very confusing and cluttered because I am not a professional programmer. You are free to add a pull request to this repository to clean up my code, add a feature, or squash some bugs. For now, I've tested it enough to say it works in most cases, but if you encounter a case where it errors out or doesn't work properly, put it in the discussions.

This script is very heavily based (I just modified the code) on the original xy_grid.py created by AUTOMATIC1111 for stable-diffusion-webui, so it includes all the same features.

I'm calling this an Alpha release because it is by no means complete or bug free, and definitely has some things left over from development.
